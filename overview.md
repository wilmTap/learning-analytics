#Overview of the Framework

The core of the framework is the Learning Records Warehouse (LRW).  
This holds data:
* about student learning activity (in xAPI format)
* about the student. (in Jisc UDD format)

Universities and colleges can provide access to developers and applications to submit data to the LRW, and to retrieve it.

This data can be used for predicative analytics, to provide dashboards for staff and students, and to build any other learning application that can make use of this data set, as long is it complies with [https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/code-of-practice-for-learning-analytics] (Jisc's Learning Analytics code of practice)

##Example application flows

### Example flow for a student facing application

1) The student authenticates via the [http://www.ukfederation.org.uk/] (UK Access Federation)
2) The application then gets an identifier.  It use this to match to more information about the student using the Student Universal Data Definition APIs, such as student name and what courses they are taken.
3) The application can then access the Actvity data from LRW, calling the appropriate API (documented below) to get student activity on that course.
4) The application can then process the data into the appropriate format and present to the student.

### Example flow for a predictive model applications

1) Historic Activity Data is extracted from the LRW.
2) History Data about the student is extracted from the LRW
3) This data is use to created predictive models
4) Additiona Activity and Course performance data is pulled from the LRW at a regular interval.
5) Predications of student achievement and updated with the new data.
6) Alerts are generated if a student in not predicted to succeed.

##More about the data

### Activity Data
Activity data is stored in xAPI (or Tincan Format).  For information on Tincan see [http://tincanapi.com/](http://tincanapi.com/).

Activity data is provided by application that students use. Currently this includes plugins for Moodle and Blackboard, with other plugins under development.

The framework defines a set of xAPI recipes for common activity data, and data submitted should conform to these recipies. Currently the following recipies are available.

More information about about activity data is available on [activity-data.md](activity-data.md#)


### Student Data

Student data is stored against a standard data model. On universities and colleges can submit data to the LRW. Data is stored against a standard model, and authorised applications can access data via RESTful APIs.

The Universal Data Definition model is documented in Github.
